# Render the AIO nginx server block for the WebUI port, picking HTTP or HTTPS
# based on whether hs.direct has provisioned a cert. SINGLE source of truth for
# that decision, called from TWO places:
#   - docker-entrypoint-aio.sh, at container start.
#   - server/lib/hsdirect.js (reloadNginx), right after a cert lands at pairing
#     time - so the box flips HTTP->HTTPS without waiting for a restart.
#
# `nginx -s reload` only re-reads the files already on disk; it does NOT re-run
# the entrypoint. So the cert-landing reload MUST re-render first, or nginx keeps
# serving the plain-HTTP default.conf and every TLS handshake fails (400 ->
# ERR_SSL_PROTOCOL_ERROR). This script does that render; the caller reloads.
#
# Inputs (env): ABS_SERVER_URL, PUBLIC_URL, HS_APP_ORIGIN. HSDIRECT_STABLE_HOST
# is read from /config/hsdirect/stable_host; HSDIRECT_PUBLIC_HOST (host:port) is
# derived from /config/hsdirect/public_url.
