# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Summary

HearthShelf is a browser-first, self-hosted replacement UI/UX for AudiobookShelf (ABS).
ABS remains the backend server and the source of truth for all library data,
playback sessions, and progress. HearthShelf is mostly **the face** - a UI layer
over the ABS REST API and Socket.io interface - with one small backend of its own:
the QuestGiver service (`server/`), which holds the AI provider key, enforces rate
limits, and persists HearthShelf-specific state (app settings, QuestGiver config /
history, Discover feedback) in an embedded SQLite database. It never duplicates
ABS data. See `docs/database.md`.

Domain: hearthshelf.com - Type: static SPA + a small Node backend, served via
nginx in a Docker container.

## Evidence-Based Development

Never make changes without confirming functions, APIs, and types exist by observing them.

Verify through:
- AudiobookShelf API documentation (see `docs/api-integration.md` for endpoint references)
- Direct code observation in this repo
- Never guess or rely on memory for ABS response shapes - all shapes live in `src/api/types.ts`

When citing changes, reference specific endpoints, existing patterns, and line numbers
where applicable.

## Critical Rules

- **TypeScript strict mode**: No `any`. No unused imports (ts(6133) is an error).
- **All ABS response shapes** defined in `src/api/types.ts` - one source of truth.
- **No CORS hacks in app code**: all ABS calls go through `/abs-api/*` (nginx proxies).
- **Token handling**: Bearer token from `authStore`, persisted to `localStorage` (token only).
- **Player bar is persistent**: it stays rendered across route changes - never unmount it
  on navigation.
- **Progress sync discipline**: sync every 30s while playing + on session close via
  `navigator.sendBeacon` on `beforeunload`.
- **shadcn/ui components are owned source** in `src/components/ui/` - generated via CLI,
  treated as our code, not a node_modules dependency.
- **Tailwind utility classes only** - no custom CSS files except CSS variable definitions
  in `index.css`.
- **One component per file**, file name matches export name.
- **Never git push** unless explicitly told - pushes can trigger CI/CD.

## Out of Scope for v0.1

Podcasts, search, filtering/sorting, collections/playlists, bookmarks, offline/PWA,
admin controls, Chromecast, theme toggle (dark only), mobile-optimized layout, downloads,
ebook reader, stats, series browsing. See `docs/scope.md` for the full list.
