# All-in-one entrypoint: run nginx, the bundled AudiobookShelf server, and the
# HearthShelf backend in one container. nginx is the only ingress (port 80); ABS
# listens on 127.0.0.1:13378 and HearthShelf's backend on 127.0.0.1:8080, both
# reached only through nginx. tini (PID 1) reaps children; this script supervises
# them and exits if any one dies, so Docker's restart policy recycles the box.

# hs.direct cert ACQUISITION lives in the HearthShelf backend now (it runs at the
# pairing moment and on boot, because the control-plane credentials only exist
# after pairing - see server/lib/hsdirect.js). Here we just consume what the
# backend persisted on a prior run: if a cert + stable host already exist, use the
# synthesized PUBLIC_URL and enable the :443 block below. A freshly-paired box
# gets its cert from the backend within seconds and serves :443 after the backend
# reloads nginx (or on the next restart). No env var required - it just works once
# paired, unless the admin set HSDIRECT_DISABLED.
