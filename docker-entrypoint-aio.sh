# All-in-one entrypoint: run nginx, the bundled AudiobookShelf server, and the
# HearthShelf backend in one container. nginx is the only ingress (port 80); ABS
# listens on 127.0.0.1:13378 and HearthShelf's backend on 127.0.0.1:8080, both
# reached only through nginx. tini (PID 1) reaps children; this script supervises
# them and exits if any one dies, so Docker's restart policy recycles the box.

# --- hs.direct: pick up a previously provisioned cert + public URL ------------
# hs.direct cert ACQUISITION lives in the HearthShelf backend now (it runs at the
# pairing moment and on boot, because the control-plane credentials only exist
# after pairing - see server/lib/hsdirect.js). Here we just consume what the
# backend persisted on a prior run: if a cert + stable host already exist, use the
# synthesized PUBLIC_URL and enable the :443 block below. A freshly-paired box
# gets its cert from the backend within seconds and serves :443 after the backend
# reloads nginx (or on the next restart). No env var required - it just works once
# paired, unless the admin set HSDIRECT_DISABLED.

# SINGLE-PORT model (Plex-style): the container listens on ONE port (:80, mapped
# to the host's WebUI port, e.g. 9277). Before a cert exists we serve plain HTTP
# there for LAN access. Once hs.direct has provisioned a cert, we serve HTTPS on
# that SAME port instead - so hs.direct is https://<host>:<that port>, the user
# forwards one port, and there is no second port to map. The render decision (HTTP
# vs HTTPS) lives in render-hsdirect.sh so the backend can re-run the SAME logic
# when a cert lands at pairing time and reload nginx, flipping HTTP->HTTPS without
# a restart (a bare `nginx -s reload` re-reads the old files and would not flip).

# --- bundled AudiobookShelf ---
# ABS reads PORT/CONFIG_PATH/METADATA_PATH from the environment. We keep these
# in ABS_*-prefixed vars in the image so they never collide with HearthShelf's
# own config, then map them in just for the ABS process.
#
# ROUTER_BASE_PATH="" runs ABS at the origin ROOT instead of its /audiobookshelf
# default. nginx already proxies ABS at root (/api, /auth, /socket.io ... with no
# /audiobookshelf prefix), so this aligns ABS's router mount with how we proxy it.
# It also makes ABS's OIDC web-callback validator (isValidWebCallbackUrl) accept a
# relative callback like /hs/hosted/connect-return: that check requires the
# callback path to start with RouterBasePath, and /audiobookshelf would reject our
# HearthShelf-served relay path. Empty base path -> the check is just startsWith('/').
